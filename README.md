# RIT.ts
A TypeScript package for interacting with api.rit.edu.

# Getting Started
Run ``npm install rit.ts`` in your NodeJS project, then it's as easy as:

```ts
import { TigerClient } from "rit.ts";

const RITClient:TigerClient = new TigerClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

More documentation hopefully coming soon.

# Contributing
Don't forget to make a ``.env`` file defining an ``RIT_API_KEY`` if you're going to contribute to development!
